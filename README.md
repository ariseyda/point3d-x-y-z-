# point3d-x-y-z-
Define a structure called point3d that encapsulates values for x, y, and z coordinates of a point and following functions:  
- a function to display a point3d variable.  
- a function to receive coordinates of a point3d variable from user.  
- a function to compute distance between two point3d variables.  
- a function to check if two point3d variables are same or not.  
Test your functions in a program.
